Talks I gave in 2011
====================

November. **Bioimage Informatics: Computer Vision for Biology** This was part
of the EMBO course on `Imaging Infection
<http://microscopy.synbio.scientific-solution.com/>`__ that took place at CSIR
in Pretoria. I have a `few notes </talks/2011/embo>`__ and `the slides </files/talks/2011/lpc-embo-presentation.pdf>`__

September 22. **Studying the subcellular location space with bioimages and
other data modalities** This was a tutorial-like seminar on Bioimage analysis.
It also included some new results, but I have left them out of the `online
version </files/talks/2011/lpc-udel.pdf>`__ of the slides.

July 20. **Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School**: Day 0 Introduction to
Programming in Python. This was a 90 minute talk with a lab session in the
afternoon. `Slides </files/talks/2011/lpc-lxmls-2011.pdf>`__

March 23. **Pittsburgh Python Users Group**: *Introduction to Scientific Programming in
Python*. This was a lightening talk (5--10 minutes), so there is not a lot of
meat, but I did draw some cool pictures. `Slides
