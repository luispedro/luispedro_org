Jug: A Task-Based Parallelization Framework
===========================================

Citation
--------

If you use Jug to generate results for a scientific publication, please cite:

    Coelho, L.P., (2017). Jug: Software for Parallel Reproducible Computation in
    Python. Journal of Open Research Software. 5(1), p.30.

What is it?
-----------
It is a *light-weight, Python only, distributed computing framework.*

Jug allows you to write code that is broken up into tasks and run different
tasks on different processors. You can also think of it as a lightweight
map-reduce type of system, although it's a bit more flexible (and less
scalable).

It has two storage backends: One uses the filesystem to communicate between
processes and works correctly over NFS, so you can coordinate processes on
different machines. The other uses a redis database and all it needs is for
different processes to be able to communicate with a common redis server.

Jug is a pure Python implementation and should work on any platform. Python 3
is also supported (at least 3.3 and greater).

Short Example
-------------

Here is a one minute example. Save the following to a file called ``primes.py``::

    from jug import TaskGenerator
    from time import sleep

    @TaskGenerator
    def is_prime(n):
        sleep(1.)
        for j in xrange(2,n-1):
            if (n % j) == 0:
                return False
        return True

    primes100 = map(is_prime, xrange(2,101))

Of course, this is only for didactical purposes, normally you would use a
better method. Similarly, the ``sleep`` function is so that it does not run too
fast.

Now type ``jug status primes.py`` to get::

    Task name                    Waiting       Ready    Finished     Running
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    primes.is_prime                    0          99           0           0
    ........................................................................
    Total:                             0          99           0           0


This tells you that you have 99 tasks called ``primes.is_prime`` ready to run.
So run ``jug execute primes.py &``. You can even run multiple instances in the
background (if you have multiple cores, for example). After starting 4
instances and waiting a few seconds, you can check the status again (with ``jug
status primes.py``)::

    Task name                    Waiting       Ready    Finished     Running
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    primes.is_prime                    0          63          32           4
    ........................................................................
    Total:                             0          63          32           4


Now you have 32 tasks finished, 4 running, and 63 still ready. Eventually, they
will all finish and you can inspect the results with ``jug shell primes.py``.
This will give you an ``ipython`` shell. The `primes100` variable is available,
but it is an ugly list of `jug.Task` objects. To get the actual value, you call
the `value` function::

    In [1]: primes100 = value(primes100)

    In [2]: primes100[:10]
    Out[2]: [True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True]

Where can I get this?
---------------------

`PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Jug>`_ for stable releases, github_ for the
cutting edge. The code is licensed MIT.

You should be able to use ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::

    pip install jug
    easy_install jug

Features
--------

- Persistent data across runs
- Re-use partial results if you change the algorithms (for example, if you
  search over a few more parameters for the best, then it will reuse the
  pre-computed values). Normally, I have a main computation script and then
  write a second visualisation script to plot out the results or compute some
  summary statistics and it's good if the second script is easy to write, easy
  to change, and reuses all computational results seamlessly.
- Supports concurrency with a very flexible system: CPUs can join the
  computation at any time. This allows it to be used in batch processing
  systems.
- You can check up on the status of the computation at any time (`jug status`)
- Two backends: file-based if all the processors share a filesystem (works over
  NFS too) or `redis <http://code.google.com/p/redis/>`_ based if they can all
  connect to the same redis server.
