Python Morphology Toolbox
=========================

Pymorph is a collection of pure python implementations of many image morphology
functions.

Mahotas
-------

Pymorph is still available and bug-free, but I am not adding any new features.
My other computer vision package, `mahotas </software/mahotas>`__, is a C++
implementation and is much faster.

It started small, but now has almost all of the functionality of pymorph and a
lot of functionality that pymorph did not have. Even for the functionality that
is shared with pymorph, mahotas is almost always a better choice (mainly for
the fact that `it is faster <http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jors.ac>`__).

Additionally, mahotas has functionality that pymorph never had (nor will have).

Download & Install
------------------

You can use `easy_install` or `pip`:::

    easy_install pymorph
    pip install pymorph

If you want the code, it can be downloaded as a `source tar.gz
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymorph>`_ file from pypi. Installation follows
the typical

   python setup.py install


Documentation
-------------

Autogenerated `API Docs <http://packages.python.org/pymorph/>`_ are very complete.

The book *Hands-On Morphological Image Processing* provides some of the
background, but is based on the older release.

Releases
--------

Since there is feature stability, I release on `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymorph>`_ whenever I have fixed a new bug (to make
it easy for people who use `easy_install` or `pip` to keep up).

For more minor fixes (documentation reformatting), you can check the continuous
release on `github`_.

.. _github: http://github.com/luispedro/pymorph/

The package is very stable, so tracking the development release should not cause
you any problem.

Support
-------

The official forum for discussion of pymorph issues is the `pythonvision
mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/pythonvision>`_. Also, check out
`pythonvision.org <http://pythonvision.org>`_ while you're at it.

For bug reports, `mail me <mailto:luis@luispedro.org>`_. If you report a bug, I
will try to fix it. If it has a unit test, I **promise** to fix it.

Currently, **there are no known bugs**, but, because the package does not have
automatic tests and there have been interface changes in numpy (when compared
to Numeric), there are certainly unknown bugs, which is why I *need* people to
report them.

Contributions
-------------

New contributions are welcome. At best, start from the `github`_ version and
either branch it or just email me a patch. Right now, good test bug reports are
a needed contribution.

TODO
----
- Write more tests.
- Re-format the documentation. The previous documentation was a bit too verbose
  for my taste and not in any standard format. I am slowly re-writing some of
  it in restructured text.
- Do something about the demos. They don't work. I need to either fix them or
  delete them.

Once these are done, I will release this as 1.0

History
-------
This started as the `Python Morphology Toolbox <http://www.mmorph.com/pymorph/>`_.
It was a very nice piece of software, written by Roberto A. Lutofu and Rubens C.
Machado. Unfortunately, the code had been allowed to rot and did not work with
the more recent `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ libraries.

Since discovering their code, I have been using it and making changes so that
it runs with modern numpy. I have now adopted the package and am reworking it
more deeply than just a fix here and there.

Changes from Original
---------------------

The most important change has been the *removal of superfluous functions*.
Functions that deal with **image input/output** or **image display** *have been
removed*. The reason is that `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
is a much better implementation of this. I see no point in going through the
effort of maintaining thin wrappers around its functionality. For plotting, use
matplotlib (it also has a *imread* function based on `PIL
<http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_).

I removed the *mm*  prefix from function names. Function name prefixes are
needed in Matlab, which does not have namespaces, but they're un-Pythonic
(given that Python has namespaces).

I also changed other small things, including removing some functions which were
superfluous. See the CHANGES_SINCE_08 file in the distribution. A module called
pymorph.compat contains old function names as well as all the functions that
were removed. If you have code which depends on the old names, use this.
Otherwise, I recommend you use the new names. I will remove `compat` for
version 1.0 as I would like that version to be a clean one. Argument names have
changed (and are becoming standartised across the package). These changes
should only affect you if you call functions using argument name syntax
(`f(arg=2)` instead of `f(2)`).

I have also implemented a couple of missing functions (like *watershed*).

There have been many bugfixes across the package too.
