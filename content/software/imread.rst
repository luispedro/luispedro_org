Mahotas-imread: Reads images into numpy arrays
==============================================

A dedicated  page with documentation is available at `http://imread
<http://imread.rtfd.org>`__. This page is just a summary.

If you are using mahotas-imread in a scientific publication, please cite the
`mahotas </software/mahotas>`__ paper (imread is an off-shoot and does not,
currently, have its own paper):

    Coelho, L.P. 2013. Mahotas: Open source software for scriptable computer
    vision. Journal of Open Research Software 1(1):e3, DOI:
    http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jors.ac


This project is a spin off of mahotas (for reasons of maintainability, I felt
it was better to not emcumber mahotas with all the IO code that imread
contains).

This is a simple module, which has two main functions

imread
    reads an image from a file

imsave
    saves an image to a file

It currently works on PNG, JPEG, and TIFF (including some TIFF variations such
as STK or LSM).

Where can I get it?
