(2013) Generalisable Subcellular Location Analysis
--------------------------------------------------

Most of subcellular location analysis in the past has been pursued using
datasets that contain multiple copies of the same *representative* protein
(i.e., a specific protein is selected to serve as a **nuclear protein**,
another to serve as a **microtubular** protein). Algorithms are then evaluated
by measuring their ability to recognise this protein. It has then been inferred
that the algorithm is thus capable of recognizing location patterns.
Unfortunately, this is a leap of judgement that has not been tested. We tested
this using a new dataset with multiple proteins standing in the same location
group. The algorithms we were using previously performed significantly worse in
this new dataset and we thus employed new methods to achieve better results.

The paper describing this work has been published in Bioinformatics:

   *Determining the subcellular location of new proteins from microscope images
   using local features* by **Luis Pedro Coelho**, Joshua D. Kangas, Armaghan
   Naik, Elvira Osuna-Highley, Estelle Glory-Afshar, Margaret Fuhrman, Ramanuja
   Simha, Peter B. Berget, Jonathan W. Jarvik, and Robert F.  Murphy (2013).

Local Features for Bioimage Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We also show that using `SURF <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SURF>`__ (a form of
local features which achieves excellent results in subcellular classification
and we recommend it for bioimage analysis).

This is a video abstract which includes the main results of the paper:

(2010) Unsupervised Subcellular Pattern Unmixing
------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project was to extend the supervised unmixing methods to an
unsupervised setting. The results were surprisingly good: *unsupervised is as
good as supervised.*

(2009) Nuclear Segmentation
---------------------------

This was an off-shoot of my work on RandTag. The goal was to figure out the
best segmentation algorithm for our data in an unbiased, quantitative, way. We
built a data set of hand-segmented images and tried out a few algorithms.

(2009-2010) SLIF: Structured Literature Image Finder
----------------------------------------------------

The `SLIF Project </projects/slif>`__

On this project, I worked mainly on the image handling half of the pipeline,
but also on integration of the whole system. The work I did on the image
pipeline included using active learning techniques for dataset generation, and
development of multi-class image classifiers.

Slif is available at `http://slif.cbi.cmu.edu <http://slif.cbi.cmu.edu>`__.
