Bioimage Informatics Datasets
=============================

These datasets in bioimage informatics were part of publications which required
them and were labeled by myself and co-authors.

Subcellular location determination
----------------------------------

This is a pair of **image classification** dataset, consisting of imgaes of
fluorescently tagged proteins in NIH 3T3 cells.

   *Determining the subcellular location of new proteins from microscope images
   using local features* by **Luis Pedro Coelho**, Joshua D. Kangas, Armaghan
   Naik, Elvira Osuna-Highley, Estelle Glory-Afshar, Margaret Fuhrman, Ramanuja
   Simha, Peter B. Berget, Jonathan W. Jarvik, and Robert F.  Murphy (2013).

Nuclear segmentation
--------------------

This is a hand-labeled dataset of image segmentations.

**Reference**

    *Nuclear segmentation in microscope cell images: A hand-segmented dataset
    and comparison of algorithms* by Luis Pedro Coelho, Aabid Shariff, and
    Robert F.  Murphy [`DOI 10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193098
