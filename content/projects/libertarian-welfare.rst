This is a book which will be called *The Libertarian Welfare State.* The major
thesis is explained in the following quote from Hayek:

    There is little reason why the government should not also play some role,
    or even take the intiative, in such areas as social insurance and
    education, or temporarily subsidize certain experimental developments. Our
    problem here is not so much the aims as the methods of government action.

It argues that a libertarian welfare state is not only more efficient, but
morally superior as it treats the beneficiaries with greater respect.

It can be seen as a liberaltarian project, if you wish, but I rather just call
it straight libertarian. Or we can start calling Hayek and Milton Friedman
liberaltarians.

The book is continuously available `on github <https://github.com/luispedro/libertarian-welfare>`__

I will be using the twitter moniker 
`@libwelfare <https://twitter.com/#!/libwelfare>`__
for this project (in case you do not care to follow my other ramblings).
