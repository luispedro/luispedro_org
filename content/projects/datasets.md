# Bioimage Informatics Datasets

These datasets in bioimage informatics were part of publications which
required them and were labeled by myself and co-authors.

## Subcellular location determination

This is a pair of **image classification** dataset, consisting of imgaes
of fluorescently tagged proteins in NIH 3T3 cells.

## Nuclear segmentation

This is a hand-labeled dataset of image segmentations.
