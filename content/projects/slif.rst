SLIF: Structured Literature Image Finder
========================================

SLIF is the *Structured Literature Image Finder` (previously, *Subcellular
Location Image Finder*), which was project from the `Murphy Lab <http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu>`__, which I was a part of.
It searches through scientific journals, looking for images, which it
categorises, makes available, and (partially) analyses.

The figure above (from `Coelho et al., 2010`_) is a
diagram of the SLIF pipeline: figures are extracted from papers, broken up into
panels & captions, which are then analysed to build navigavtion models.

In this project, I was responsible for the computer vision aspects of the
processing pipeline. I also handled much of the integration effort of the
several components and coordinated the preparation of the multi-author
publications that resulted from the effort. This project was a finalist in the
`Elsevier Grand Challenge <http://www.elseviergrandchallenge.com/>`__ (4 teams
out of 70 were chosen for the final). I represented our team in both the
semi-final and the final of this competition.

The SLIF page on the Murphy Lab website `many more details <http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/services/SLIF/>`__,
including some historical information and presentation materials.

These are the most recent references, on which I was involved. The first paper
focus most on the image analysis side of the pipeline, the second of the
overall service.
