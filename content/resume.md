### Languages

- Bilingual: **Portuguese** and **English**
- Fluent oral and good written **German** (attended a German-speaking school,
  grades 5 through 12; spent a year at the Technical University of Austria).
- Fluent oral and good written **French**
- Basic knowledge of **Spanish** and **Luxembourgish**

### Teaching

**Designed and taught** a course in computer programming for the sciences
([Programming for Scientists](/pfs)). This was a semester-long course taught
at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2009 (as a student-taught course). In
2012, I taught a shortened version of this at IMM as a two-and-a-half day
workshop. I am a certified [software carpentry
instructor](https://software-carpentry.org/pages/team.html)

**Teaching Assistant** for Decision Support Systems at Technical University of
Lisbon (Spring 2005). Co-designed and co-taught a Computer Initiation Course for
Adults in a social housing project (pro-bono). *Teaching Assistant* for
Laboratory Methods for Computational Biology at Carnegie Mellon University
(Spring 2008).

### Local Committee for Portuguese-American Postgraduate Society National Forum

I headed the local organising committee for the 2010 edition of this annual
event. It took place in Pittsburgh and included, as speakers, cabinet-level
Portuguese government officials, renowned researchers, artists, as well as
participants from all around the US.

### Open Source Programming

I publish and maintainx many open source projects of interest to his research,
such as image processing or machine learning code. In particular
[mahotas](https://github.com/luispedro/mahotas) (ca. 6,000 downloads per month)
is a [computer vision library in
Python](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/article/view/jors.ac).
