Here are a few things I use all the time, so I decided to start writing
them down instead of always re-deriving them on the fly.

Some were checked with [Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/). I tend to make
silly mistakes when I think that \"it\'s just manipulations now\", so I
like the check.

1.  [Multiplication of two
    gaussians](/files/derivations/two_gaussians.pdf) (includes all
    normalisations, unlike other derivations online which stop at \"here
    is a Normal distribution\")
2.  [Convolution of two
    Gaussians](/files/derivations/gaussian_integral.pdf)
3.  [Bayesian odds ratio of
    multinomials](/files/derivations/multinomials.pdf) I don\'t know of
    any piece of software which can check this one, so you\'ll have to
    take it on faith.
