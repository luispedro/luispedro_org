Talks I gave in 2011
====================

September 22. **Studying the subcellular location space with bioimages and
other data modalities** This was a tutorial-like seminar on Bioimage analysis.
It also included some new results, but I have left them out of the `online
version </files/talks/2011/lpc-udel.pdf>`__ of the slides.

July 20. **Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School**: Day 0 Introduction to
Programming in Python. This was a 90 minute talk with a lab session in the
afternoon. `Slides </files/talks/2011/lpc-lxmls-2011.pdf>`__

March 23. **Pittsburgh Python Users Group**: *Introduction to Scientific Programming in
Python*. This was a lightening talk (5--10 minutes), so there is not a lot of
meat, but I did draw some cool pictures. `Slides
