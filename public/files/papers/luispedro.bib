    occurrences in $O(3^k m^{k+1} + ed)$ time, where $m$ is the length of the
    pattern and ed and the number of matching edit scripts. The construction of
    the structure has time bound by $O(kNS)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes
    in the index and $S$ the alphabet size.},

    abstract={We propose an adaptive multiresolution (MR) approach to the
    classification of fingerprint images. The system adds MR decomposition in
    front of a generic classifier consisting of feature computation and
    classification in each MR subspace, yielding local decisions, which are
    then combined into a global decision using a weighting algorithm. In our
    previous work on classification of protein subcellular location images, we
    showed that the space-frequency localized information in the MR subspaces
    adds significantly to the discriminative power of the system. Here, we go
    one step farther; We develop a new weighting method which allows for the
    discriminative power of each subband to be expressed and examined within
    each class. This, in turn, allows us to evaluate the importance of the
    information contained within a specific subband. Moreover, we develop a
    pruning procedure to eliminate the subbands that do not contain useful
    information. This leads to potential identification of the appropriate MR
    decomposition both on a per class basis and for a given dataset. With this
    new approach, we make the system adaptive, flexible as well as more
    accurate and efficient.},

    abstract = {Our group has previously used machine learning techniques to
    develop computational systems to automatically analyse fluorescence
    microscope images and classify the location of the depicted protein. Based
    on this work, we developed a system, the Subcellular Location Image Finder
    (slif), which mines images from scientifioc journals for analysis.

    For some of the images in journals, the system is able to automatically compute
    the pixel resolution (the physical space represented by each pixel), by
    identifying a scale bar and processing the caption text. However, scale bars
    are not always included. For those images, the pixel resolution is unknown.
    Blindly feeding these images into the classification pipeline results in
    unacceptably low accuracy. We first describe methods that minimise the impact
    of this problem by training resolution-insensitive classifiers.

    We show that these techniques are of limited use as classifiers can only be
    made insensitive to resolutions which are similar to each other. We then
    approach the problem in a different way by trying to estimate the resolution
    automatically and processing the image based on this prediction. Testing on
    digitally down-sampled images shows that the combination of these two
    approaches gives classification results which are essentially as good as if the
    resolution had been known.},

    abstract = {With the advent of high-throughput microscopes, researchers can
    routinely image hundreds of different proteins per day, generating
    thousands of images. To be able to organize these images and extract
    meaningful information, we need automatic methods. The state-of-the-art in
    automated subcellular localization is classification in the space of image
    features. This approach is not suited, however, for handling mixture
    patterns (the pattern of a protein present in more than one location).

    We have previously described methods for determining the fraction of
    fluorescence in various subcellular locations when the basic locations in
    which a protein can be present are given a priori. However, knowing all
    fundamental patterns a priori may be problematic. The alternative is
    unsupervised unmixing: given a set of images from different proteins,
    identify the basic patterns that best explain all the observed images as
    either examples of such basic patterns or combinations thereof. 

    We extend our previous work to handle this problem. Using a validation
    dataset, we show that this method can recover the underlying mixed
    patterns. It identifies meaningful basis patterns and mixture coefficients
    that correlate well with the probe concentrations that generated the
    dataset (the probe concentrations were kept hidden from the algorithm).},

    abstract={Protein subcellular location is one of the most important
    determinants of protein function during cellular processes. Changes in
    protein behavior during the cell cycle are expected to be involved in
    cellular reprogramming during disease and development, and there is
    therefore a critical need to understand cell-cycle dependent variation in
    protein localization which may be related to aberrant pathway activity.
    With this goal, it would be useful to have an automated method that can be
    applied on a proteomic scale to identify candidate proteins showing
    cell-cycle dependent variation of location. Fluorescence microscopy, and
    especially automated, high-throughput microscopy, can provide images for
    tens of thousands of fluorescently-tagged proteins for this purpose.
    Previous work on analysis of cell cycle variation has traditionally relied
    on obtaining time-series images over an entire cell cycle; these methods
    are not applicable to the single time point images that are much easier to
    obtain on a large scale. Hence a method that can infer cell
    cycle-dependence of proteins from asynchronous, static cell images would be
    preferable. In this work, we demonstrate such a method that can associate
    protein pattern variation in static images with cell cycle progression. We
    additionally show that a one-dimensional parameterization of cell cycle
    progression and protein feature pattern is sufficient to infer association
    between localization and cell cycle.},
