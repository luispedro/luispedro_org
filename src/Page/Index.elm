I am currently looking for postdocs to [join my group in
Shanghai](https://big-data-biology.org/positions). Come work with me on
metagenomics, antimicrobial resistance, algorithms, or just propose your
own project.

# Who am I?

I am the principal investigator of the [Big Data Biology
Lab](https://big-data-biology.org) at Fudan University (Shanghai) since
September 2018. Our group works in computational biology, with a focus
on large-scale microbiome analyses.

Previously, I worked at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in
[Peer Bork's group](https://www.embl.de/~bork/). I have a PhD from [Carnegie Mellon
University](https://www.compbio.cmu.edu/) (2011), where I worked on [bioimage
informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioimage_informatics) for subcellular
location analysis with [Bob Murphy](https://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/).

My [Erd√∂s-Bacon number is 7](/erdos-bacon).

# Upcoming Travels & Talks

**2023 Jan 9-13** At the University of Warwick

[Email me](mailto:luis@luispedro.org) if you want to set up meetings at
any of these opportunities (or to invite me for other opportunities).

If you want to chat with me about science and such, you can use [my calendly
link](https://calendly.com/luis-pedro-coelho/pub-zoom-15).

# Research Interests

**More technical version:** I am interested in combining meta\'omics
(methods that obtain high-throughput information on microbial
communities such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics) analysis with
machine learning approaches to learn about microbial communities in
different environments. I wish to answer basic questions on what
determines the structure of a microbial community in a given environment
and what are the differences/similarities between different
environments.

My work is a mix of of
[method](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n12/abs/nmeth.2693.html) and
[tool](https://ngless.embl.de) development with
[applications](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1261359). In methodological
terms, I worry a lot about [correct evaluation of
methods](https://luispedro.org/projects/gen-classification) and avoiding
over-inflated measures of performance. A large fraction of my time is spent
scaling up algorithms and [pipelines](https://doi.org/10.5334/jors.161) to work
on very-large problems.

**Not-so technical version:** With modern technology, namely robotic
instruments, it is easy to acquire a lot of microscopic pictures. It is
also possible to acquire large sequence datasets with the DNA of many
organisms. I use these two families of technologies to investigate what
is happening in mixed microbial communities such as the one in our guts,
the [microbiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiome).

In order to be able to use these data, I also need to develop new
computer methods (software) for these tasks. Thus my work is a mix of
solving biological problems and tackling the software issues that stand
in the way of doing so.
