Languages
.........

- Bilingual: **Portuguese** and **English**
- Fluent oral and good written **German** (attended a German-speaking school,
  grades 5 through 12; spent a year at the Technical University of Austria).
- Fluent oral and good written **French**
- Basic knowledge of **Spanish** and **Luxembourgish**

Teaching
........

**Designed and taught** a course in computer programming for the sciences
(`Programming for Scientists </pfs>`__). This was a semester-long course taught
at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2009 (as a student-taught course). In
2012, I taught a shortened version of this at IMM as a two-and-a-half day
workshop. I am a certified `software carpentry instructor
<http://software-carpentry.org/pages/team.html>`__

**Teaching Assistant** for Decision Support Systems at Technical University of
Lisbon (Spring 2005). Co-designed and co-taught a Computer Initiation Course for
Adults in a social housing project (pro-bono). *Teaching Assistant* for
Laboratory Methods for Computational Biology at Carnegie Mellon University
(Spring 2008).

Local Committee for Portuguese-American Postgraduate Society National Forum
...........................................................................

I headed the local organising committee for the 2010 edition of this annual
event. It took place in Pittsburgh and included, as speakers, cabinet-level
Portuguese government officials, renowned researchers, artists, as well as
participants from all around the US.

Producer for IST Theatre Group
..............................
I served as the producer for the IST Theatre Group, which is one of the top
university theatre groups in Portugal. We participated in several festivals,
including international festivals. As producer, my activities included
fund-raising and management.

Open Source Programming
.......................
I publish and maintainx many open source projects of interest to his research,
such as image processing or machine learning code. In particular `mahotas
<https://github.com/luispedro/mahotas>`__ (ca. 6,000 downloads per month) is a
`computer vision library in Python
<http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/article/view/jors.ac>`__.
