Programming for Scientists is a course I designed for scientists who write
code. The project grew out of informal discussions with others, but it
crystalised around the observation that many scientists now write code as one
of their primary activities (at least as defined on time spent) without a
proper formal background for it.

As I was looking for similar courses, I found `Software Carpentry`_ by Greg
Wilson in Toronto whose aims are very similar. So, my course not only has a
*software carpentry* section, but the whole project was heavily inspired by
Greg's work.

The resulting course was taught at CMU in Spring 2009. In 2012, I taught a
mini-version at IMM. Every time, the course has improved and I would like to
have more opportunities to teach it.
