meta: We present a benchmark dataset for segmentation of nuclei in fluorescent microscopy images of cells and a comparison of several algorithms.

The goal of this project was to quantitatively evaluate a series of nuclear
segmentation algorithms for use in our work. We hand-segmented several images
from two datasets and used those as gold standards to evaluate methods.

We generated two datasets, *U2OS* and *NIH3T3*, named after the cell type that was imaged.

A model based method developed by B. Roysam's group (`Lin et al., 2003
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14566936>`__) was the best of the methods
we evaluated at the time. In the meanwhile, however, other groups have reported
better results on our dataset (`list of citations at Google Scholar
